# Getting Started

## The Application

The a brief discription of the application we are going to build is as follows:


The aim is to produce a website which allows *users* of the of the site to
*view* and *rate* cocktail recipes submitted by other users, as well as
*submit their own*. Any *visitors* to the site can view the list *sorted by
rating*, but they must *register* with an *email* and *password* in order to
*rate* or *add* a *receipe*.

Ratings will be *star* ratings with *users* being able to *rate* a receipe
with 1 to 5 *stars*.

*Quantities* can be entered as either *millilitres (ml)*, *fluid ounces (fl
oz)* or *teaspoons (tsp)*.

The cocktails ingredients available are limited to a selection which can only
be added to by an *administrator*.


Now we've got a basic understand of application we are going to build let's
take a quick look at the list of [user stories](#user-stories). These are
listed in order of priority.

* A visitor can view a list of recipes
* A visitor can register and become a user
* A visitor can login to become a user
* A user can rate a recipe
* A user can add a recipe
* An administrator can add an ingredient

We will proceed to implement each of these stories in order. This may seem like
a very basic application but it will provide enough functionality to give a
good example of how to start building a well designed, extendable application.
Also because this is being developed emulating an *agile* approach things may
change as it progresses and extra features may be requested.
