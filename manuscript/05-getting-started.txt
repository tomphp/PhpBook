# Getting Started

## The Application

The a brief discription of the application we are going to build is as follows:

> The aim is to produce a website which allows *users* of the of the site to
> *view* and *rate* cocktail recipes submitted by other users, as well as
> *submit their own*. Any *visitors* to the site can view the list *sorted by
> rating*, but they must *register* with an *email* and *password* in order to
> *rate* or *add* a *receipe*.
> 
> Ratings will be *star* ratings with *users* being able to *rate* a receipe
> with 1 to 5 *stars*.
> 
> *Quantities* can be entered as either *millilitres (ml)*, *fluid ounces (fl
> oz)* or *teaspoons (tsp)*.
> 
> The cocktail ingredients available are limited to a selection which can only
> be added to by an *administrator*.

Now we've got a basic understand of application we are going to build let's
take a quick look at the list of [user stories](#user-stories). These are
listed in order of priority.

* A visitor can view a list of recipes
* A visitor can register and become a user
* A visitor can login to become a user
* A user can rate a recipe
* A user can add a recipe
* An administrator can add an ingredient

We will proceed to implement each of these stories in order. This may seem like
a very basic application but it will provide enough functionality to give a
good example of how to start building a well designed, extendable application.
Also because this is being developed emulating an *agile* approach things may
change as it progresses and extra features may be requested.

## Creating the Project

Before jumping in let's quickly set up a project by running:

```
$ mkdir cocktail-rater
$ cd cocktail-rater
```

Then add the following `composer.json`

{title="composer.json", lang="json"}
~~~~~~~~
{
    "require-dev": {
        "behat/behat": "3.*",
        "phpunit/phpunit": "4.2.*",
        "phpspec/phpspec": "2.*@dev"
    },
    "autoload": {
        "CocktailRater\\": "src/"
    }
}
~~~~~~~~

I> ### PhpSpec Version
I>
I> You may have notice that the PHPSpec requirement is for a development
I> version. The reason for this is that there are some features which we will
I> be using which are not in the stable release, when this changes I will
I> update this accordingly.

Run composer to install the test tools:

```
$ composer install
```

Next up we can quickly configure PHPSpec to format it's output as pretty by
default so that we don't need to put it on the command line every time we run
it. To do this create a file called `phpspec.yml` with the following contents:

{title="phpspec.yml", format="yaml"}
~~~~~~~~~
formatter.name: pretty
~~~~~~~~~

Finally initialise Behat ready to start development:

```
$ behat --init
```

All done! Now we can start...
