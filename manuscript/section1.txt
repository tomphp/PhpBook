-# Prerequisites

This section of the book makes sure you have all the knowledge and tools which
will be needed to progress through the rest of the book. It will cover a lot of
topics briefly; the idea is to give you enough information on each topic for
you to progress through this book, however, each topic is pretty deep so I
don't want to try and cover any of them completely. Many of them also have
great books covering that topic exclusively and I encourage you to learn more
about each of them yourself.
