# The Development Environment

First up I will be using a Linux system in all my examples, therefore most of
the content in terms of using the command line and configuration should
translate directly if your are a Mac OS X user. If you are a Windows user
things may be a bit different but shouldn't be too hard to work out.

## Requirements

The only real requirement for working through this book is that you are using
PHP 5.5 or above and the SQLite extension. Throughout this book we will be
using PHP both from the command line and in a webserver environment.

To install PHP and SQLite on Ubuntu easily by running:

{lang="console"}
~~~~~~~~
$ sudo apt-get install php5-cli php5-sqlite
~~~~~~~~

Where we are using it in a web environment I will be using a tool called
Vagrant, it allows you to run your development environment in a virtual machine
on your computer. This removes the need to set up and configure a webserver (or
database servers) directly on your computer and therefore is the way I would
recommend doing it. However, if you do want to set up the relevant webserver &
database servers on your development machine manually, then you can do that but
you will have to work that out yourself.

## Vagrant

Vagrant is a neat little tool, it allows many developers working on the same
project to easily run a local copy of the project's environment without having
to install all the projects dependencies on their development machines. It does
this by building and running a virtual machine from a config file included in the
project.

Vagrant itself simply instructs a virtualisation provider on what type of
virtual machine to create and then uses a configuration automation system to
configure that virtual machine.

Different providers, such as VMWare, are available for use with Vagrant but I
will be using VirtualBox.

Also, different configuration automation systems, such as Chef and Puppet, can
be used with Vagrant. I am choosing to use Ansible just because I prefer the
syntax.

### Installing

In order to use Vagrant you will need to install:

* [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)
* [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/)
* [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/)

I recommend that you install both Vagrant and VirtualBox by downloading the
distribution packages directly from their websites so you get the current
versions.

With Ansible you need to make sure you have an up to date version, on Ubuntu I
tend to install it via
[Rodney Quillo's PPA](https://launchpad.net/~rquillo/+archive/ubuntu/ansible)
which as it's more up to date than the version in the Software Center.

### Creating a Vagrant Config for PHP Development

Once you have Vagrant, VirtualBox and Ansible installed its time to build a
Vagrant configuration.

It's not hard to build a Vagrant config file by hand or to build the config
automation scripts. However, it is a bit tedious, takes some learning and is
not really something this book intends to cover. Luckily there are some
fantastic online tools available which make this process a lot easier. Since we
want to build a PHP development environment and we're going to use Ansible,
let's use [Phansible](http://www.phansible.com/) to create our config for us.

First of all open http://www.phansible.com/ in your browser.

You will see a form asking questions about the development environment that you
want to create, for this example choose the following options:

| Options          | Value                         |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| Operating System | Ubuntu Trusty Tahr (14.04) 64 |
| Name             | Vagrant Example               |
| IP Address       | 192.168.5.1                   |
| Memory           | 512                           |
| Shared Folder    | ./                            |
| Webserver        | Apache + PHP5                 |
| PHP Version      | 5.5                           |

You can use different local IP address if you want but remember it as we will
need to know what it is shortly.

Ignore the **Database** and **Package** settings for now and finally choose an
appropriate **Timezone**.

Next click the **Generate** button at the bottom and save the generated `.zip`
file to your hard drive.

I saved my file to `/home/tom/Downloads/phansible_VagrantExample.zip`.

#### Creating the Project

Now we have the Vagrant configuration generated let's create a PHP project and
add the Vagrant configuration to it.

At your terminal `cd` to where ever you want to create your project:

{lang="console"}
~~~~~~~~
$ cd /home/tom/Projects
~~~~~~~~

Next create a directory for your new project and `cd` into it:

{lang="console"}
~~~~~~~~
$ mkdir VagrantExample
$ cd VagrantExample
~~~~~~~~

Now create a file inside this directory called `index.php` and with your
favourite IDE or text editor and add the following content:

<<[index.php](examples/chapter-01/VagrantExample/index.php)

Next unpack the contents of the Vagrant configuration `.zip` file that we
downloaded from the Phansible website earlier,

{lang="console"}
~~~~~~~~
$ unzip /home/tom/Downloads/phansible_VagrantExample.zip
~~~~~~~~

Finally, while still inside the project's directory and with your computer
connected to the Internet, run:

{lang="console"}
~~~~~~~~
$ vagrant up
~~~~~~~~

This may take some time and you may be prompted to enter your password to allow
Vagrant to `sudo` to update some config files, but just be patient.

When it is done, open your browser and enter the IP address we selected earlier
into the location bar like so:

`http://192.168.5.1/`

If all has gone to plan you should see `Hello wonderful World!` displayed on
the page! Success, we have created a PHP development environment for our
project without installing and configuring a webserver on our local machine.

Once you have marvelled in the glory of Vagrant you can shut down the virtual
machine by running:

{lang="console"}
~~~~~~~~
$ vagrant halt
~~~~~~~~

at your terminal.

E>## Shutting Down
E>
E> I have found that if I forget to shutdown my virtual machines on before I try
E> to shut down my computer it hangs during the shut down process. If you have a
E> solution to this problem I'd love to heard it!
