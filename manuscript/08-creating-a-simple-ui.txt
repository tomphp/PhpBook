# Creating a Simple User Interface

So far we've implemented the functionality of 2 of our requested features, the
problem is however, we still have nothing to show to the customer. When working
on an Agile project you need to show the customer the progress very regularly
to get feedback and direction on how to continue. In this chapter we'll get
what we have done so far to show on a page. We'll start of doing this as simply
as possible, then we'll use a modern framework to create a more serious
version.
