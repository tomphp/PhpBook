Methodologies, Techniques and Tools
===================================

In this chapter I want to introduce the paradigms, methodologies and techniques
incorperated in this book. Like the previous chapter I don't want to go into
any real depth with any of these topics, rather I just want to give a primer on
the various subjects which should be enough to understand the content of this
book. As always I do encourage you dig deeper into each of the subjects
yourself. I will provide references of where to start looking when you want
to do this.

Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
---------------------------

Sometimes I think there is a misconception that if you use classes in your code
then you are doing OOP. This is not the case, OOP is an approach to modelling
which involves grouping related data and behavior (methods) in your code as
classes and then defining how they interact with each other.

OOP style of programming can be even be done in languages which have no
concepts of classes and classes can be used ways which really doesn't represent
good OO code.

This is not a book on OO design but we will be using it extensively and I will
be explaining my choices for doing the things I do. As a result coming in cold
you will probably get a good feel for OOP but if this is the case you should
go and learn more on the subject. If you have some experience of OOP but are
not an expert then I hope you will really have a lot to gain from this book.

Before moving on I just want to quickly cover a couple of OO topics.
