Modern PHP Architecture Book
============================

This is a WIP version of a book I am writing on Modern PHP Architecture. I have
put it freely available online to test the water, to finish this book will
require a significant amount of time which is something very precious to me.
Therefore if I can get enough interest in the first few chapters here then I
will move it to a Leanpub publication and complete it, if not I will use my
time for other things.

So if you like this book and would like to see it continues please:

* Star it on Github
* Tell other people about it
* Feel free to get in touch regarding it for any reason
