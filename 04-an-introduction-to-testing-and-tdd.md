An Introduction to Testing and TDD
==================================

Here's I'm going to quickly cover some of the testing tools we will be using
and give a brief introduction to TDD. This is an optional chapter if you are
familiar with these tools and TDD, but if you are new to it or feel you would
like to understand it better then it's worth a read.

Like most of the things I've covered so far, this chapter is just here to serve
as a brief introduction to give you what you will need to work through the rest
of this book. As always I recommend you research further with all the wonderful
resources out there.
